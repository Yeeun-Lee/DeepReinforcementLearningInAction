## How this is Organized

The code snippets, listings, and projects are all embedded in Jupyter Notebooks
organized by chapter. Visit [http://jupyter.org/install](http://jupyter.org/install) for
instructions on installing Jupyter Notebooks.

## Requirements

In order to run many of the projects, you'll need at least the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library
and [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
